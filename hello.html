	<h2>Hello</h2>
	<br>
	<p>Life moves. Always. Sometimes a little too fast. God has used this to create a longing within me to capture everything from the simple occasions, to the tiny details, to the once-in-a-life-time moments and everything in-between.</p>
	<br>
	<p>I strive to create images that say a thousand words and bring a smile to your face. When you look at your photographs I want you to remember not only what your life looked like, but what it felt like.</p>
	<br>
	<p>I hope to have the opportunity to work with you and your family to capture your connections, your personality and your love for one another!</p>
	<br>


	<h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
	<br>
	<p>I am a momma to two beautiful little souls which i affectionatley refer to as my 'little turkey's'.  Wife to the most heard-working, kind and loving man that I have ever known.  I love Jesus and love seeing the beauty and grace that He constantly opens my eyes too. </p>
	<br>
	<p>Coffee is amazing. 
I never say no to five cent candies.
I am a bell-bottom jean addict and a really bad cake decorator. 
I can't get enough of slobbery baby kisses or cafe mochas. 
And I have a passion for finding  beauty in the ordinary </p>
<br>
<p>Since my daughter was born I have seen how fast and crazy life becomes and it has became even more important to me to capture moments and memories in my family.  I hope I have the chance to capture them in your family as well! </p>
<br>
<p>Let's tell your story!</p>
